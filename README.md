- This is basically a Wikipedia of animals showing where they live and what is their count in the world at present! So, that if by chance one stumbles up-on the rouge or lost animal they know about the habitat animal lives in and can take care of them till the informed authority takes them back to their natural home! 

- Other main motive is to make people aware which are endangered and needs extra attention!
